## IDEA

Let's make it easier to understand by visualizing the sorting algorithms in the textbook.  
You will be able to directly experience the time complexity of each algorithm.  


## About Sorting Algorithms
Every algorithms have different time complexity.
The size and numbers of data can affect to the time complexity of an algorithm. 

## Sorting Algorithms Visualization
Visualization technique can compare their running time with just few clicks.
Finally, we can easily derive which algorithm is the efficient one at certain environment, i.e. specific numbers of data.

## How to use

<p>https://algo.kinetic.moe/</p>

### 1. select the algorithm u want to use.

The "Split Length" slider lets you decide how much you want to split the picture into small pieces.
"Run 1 frame Per" slider to adjust how many seconds you want to run one frame.

<p>And choose algorithm u want!</p>

### Quick Sort

```
// Sorts (a portion of) an array, divides it into partitions, then sorts those
algorithm quicksort(A, lo, hi) is 
  if lo >= 0 && hi >= 0 && lo < hi then
    p := partition(A, lo, hi) 
    quicksort(A, lo, p) // Note: the pivot is now included
    quicksort(A, p + 1, hi) 

// Divides array into two partitions
algorithm partition(A, lo, hi) is 
  // Pivot value
  pivot := A[lo] // Choose the first element as the pivot

  // Left index
  i := lo - 1 

  // Right index
  j := hi + 1

loop forever 
    // Move the left index to the right at least once and while the element at
    // the left index is less than the pivot
    do i := i + 1 while A[i] < pivot
    
    // Move the right index to the left at least once and while the element at
    // the right index is greater than the pivot
    do j := j - 1 while A[j] > pivot

    // If the indices crossed, return
    if i >= j then return j
    
    // Swap the elements at the left and right indices
    swap A[i] with A[j]

### Bubble Sort

```
procedure bubbleSort(A : list of sortable items)
    n := length(A)
    repeat
        swapped := false
        for i := 1 to n - 1 inclusive do
            if A[i - 1] > A[i] then
                swap(A[i - 1], A[i])
                swapped := true
            end if
        end for
        n := n - 1
    until not swapped
end procedure
